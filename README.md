# TNM108 Project - Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This is a project made for the university course TNM108 - Machine Learning for Social Media at Link√∂pings University 2022. 

The project is made by Anna Jonsson and Amanda Bigelius, and the goal is to make a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Algorithm.

If you're interested in the process of this project, we have a little blog here: https://codelikealady.blogspot.com/ 

## Inspiration and sources
The algorithm will be heavily based on [Nikita Silaparasetty's](https://github.com/nikitasilaparasetty) code from [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@nikitasilaparasetty/twitter-sentiment-analysis-for-data-science-using-python-in-2022-6d5e43f6fa6e)

# Requirements
In order for this algorithm to work you need to have python installed on your computer, as well as the following libraries:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html)
- [WordCloud](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/)
- [Better_Profanity](https://github.com/snguyenthanh/better_profanity)

## Install libraries using pip
To install the libraries using pip, write the following command lines one by one:

Numpy: ```pip install numpy```

Tweepy: ```pip install tweepy```

Matplotlib: ```pip install matplotlib```

Pandas: ```pip install pandas```

TextBlob: ``` pip install -U textblob ``` as well as ```python -m textblob.download_corpora``` to download the necessary NLTK corpora.

WordCloud: ```pip install wordcloud```

Better Profanity: ```pip install better_profanity```
