# TNM108 Project - Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This is a project made for the university course TNM108 - Machine Learning for Social Media at Link√∂pings University 2022. 

The project is made by Anna Jonsson and Amanda Bigelius, and the goal is to make a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Algorithm.

If you're interested in the process of this project, we have a little blog here: https://codelikealady.blogspot.com/ 

# Inspiration and sources
The algorithm will be heavily based on Nikita Silaparasetty's code from this tutorial:
